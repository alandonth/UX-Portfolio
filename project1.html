                    <h2>Ideation & Convergence</h2>
                    <p>After analyzing our research findings we established a user persona that best represented our
                        common user. We discovered that people don't want their vacation to feel
                        like work. They want the freedom and flexibility in their schedule to explore and be spontaneous
                        while still taking comfort in the fact that what they book will be worth the time and money
                        spent on it. So we dove deeper
                        into that challenge and began ideating.</p>

                    <p>From there we began to converge and identify which features were worth pursuing based on our
                        users' wants and our current capabilities. We liked the idea of creating an app that allowed our
                        users to be spontaneous. What if the user could
                        embark on a trip without knowing most of the details up front? Why not, that
                        certainly would be spontaneous.</p>

                        followed by Lo-Fi digital mockups. We then took the prototype to users to test and iterate upon.
                        After conducting guerrilla user tests, the insights gathered were organized into 4 main
                        categories and grouped based on the frequency of responses. We took these insights and iterated

                    <h2>Prototyping & Testing</h2>
                    <p>After much synthesis and analysis we arrived at our main feature. In our research we found that
                        the stresses of creating and sticking to a travel itinerary were often the reasons people didn't
                        follow through with or enjoy their vacations. WhatsHapp gives its user the ability to pick a
                        date and location, along with a few personal preferences, and is given an option of general
                        travel packages. When the date of travel arrives all transportation and hotel arrangements are
                        in place and users are given suggested events, activities, and eats that have been individually
                        chosen to provide each user with a satisying and personal experience.</p>

                    <p>We began to protoype our design through a series of of sketches and digital prototypes from low
                        fidelity to high. Starting with basic sketches we established and iterated on the basic feel of
                        the app along with the primary flow. Slowly we increased the fiedlity using Adobe XD, iterating
                        alonog the way. After we had a product ready to be tested we put it into the hands of users that
                        represented our target demographic. We received valuable feedback and put it through another
                        round of iterations before landing on a final solution.</p>
